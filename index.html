    <h2>The synopsis</h2>

  <h3>This is an ABC television series that I fell in love with even before the first episode back in 2017. The The Good Doctor tells the story of a highly skilled young surgeon who has his residency at St Bon Aventure Hospital. His intellect and ability far outweigh his ability to adapt to his surroundings and mannerisms associated with a high functioning spectrum of Autism.  The way his brain is wired portrays so intricately for the viewers as Dr. Murphy's thoughts, perceptions, and know-how play out before our very eyes.  Dr. Murphy is considered a savant and though it's never specifically mentioned, quite possibly has Asperger Syndrone on the Autism Spectrum. Over the course of 6 seasons, Shaun has proven his abilities time and time again so much so that he is truly a valuable asset to the team.</h3> </h3> </div>

      <H3>One of my favorite scenes of the show was when Shaun first romantic and intimate counterpart, Carly, his neighbor, Lea, and other co-workers went out one evening after work. Carly suspected Shaun had more feelings for his neighbor than he led on. There's reason behind it as she was one of the first to "accept" all of him just as he was.  In this scene, the admiration becomes very evident and Carly now has no doubt. They'd all gotten on the stage and were jamming to Nicki Minaj's "SuperBass". Check it out <a href="https://youtu.be/x3SMwxjwY3Q"> one of my most memorable scenes</a>
